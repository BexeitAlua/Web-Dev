        <p id="about-zoldyck">The Zoldyck Family (ゾルディック家け, Zorudikku-ke) is considered to be, by far, the deadliest and most infamous group of assassins in the world.<br>
        
        The Zoldyck Family owns and lives at the Kukuroo Mountain, a dormant volcano in the Dentora region of the Republic of Padokea, which stands at 3,722 meters (approx. 12,211 feet). Their estate is surrounded by huge stone walls guarded by a giant hunting beast named Mike and attendants highly skilled in martial arts. Only few people unrelated to the family have any information about what is within the estate. The appearances of the members of the family are unknown to the public at large, and a single photo of any of the members can be sold for millions as the identity of a single member is only known by a few individuals. Their family name alone can strike fear and terror in the underworld even more than the presence of the whole Phantom Troupe.
