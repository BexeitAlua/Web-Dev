        <p id="method-pancake"><strong>Method:</strong> <br>
            With a sieve, sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl. Break the eggs into a bowl and then add to the flour mixture. Pour in half of the milk and whisk briskly. Add the remaining milk and whisk until the batter is smooth.<br>

            Heat a 20cm non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add a small knob of butter and swirl the pan to coat the bottom.<br>
            
            Don’t wait until the pan is smoking hot. The butter will burn. Rather, flick a drop of water into the pan; if it sizzles, you are ready to add the pancake batter.<br>
            
            Using a ladle, pour the pancake batter into the pan, then tilt the pan to spread the mixture out evenly. Aim for approximately 3 tablespoons of batter. As your pancake sets, you will see small bubbles forming on its surface. Once you notice bubbles, shake the pan to see if the pancake is loose. Once the pancake is loose, and the edges have cooked a bit, it is time to flip. This should only take about a minute at the most.<br>
            
            Depending your pan, as well as your hob, you may notice that you start out well with your first pancake on medium-high heat, but that the pan quickly gets too hot. If you notice a lot of sizzling or smoking, turn down the heat to medium. Often starting at medium-high and turning to medium after you flip your first pancake works well.<br>
            
            Flip the pancake over with a palette knife or spatula.<br>
            
            Let the pancake cook on the other side for about 30 seconds; it should cook no more than half as long on this side as it took to cook the first side.<br>
            
            Check to see that the last side is a nice golden brown, then slide your pancake onto a plate and top with caster sugar and a squeeze of lemon. Add more butter to your pan and cook the remaining pancakes as stated above from step five onwards.

            First, prepare an 8×8-inch metal baking pan by spraying it lightly with cooking spray and lining it with a sheet of parchment paper. Leaving a little parchment overhang makes it easy to lift the brownies out of the pan when you’re ready to slice them.<br>
In a large mixing bowl, beat together the melted butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar.<br>
Add the eggs, vanilla and salt. Mix in with a hand mixer on low speed. Then increase the speed to medium and beat for 1 minute, or until the mixture lightens in color.<br>
Use a rubber spatula to mix in the flour and cocoa powder until just combined. Fold in the chocolate chips and/or nuts, if using.<br>
Spread the batter into an even layer in the prepared baking pan. Bake at 350° F for 25-32 minutes. Then let the brownies cool in the pan before slicing.
